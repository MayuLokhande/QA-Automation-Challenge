Part 1:
Part 1: Identify Flakiness Issues
1. Direct assert on page URL without waiting for navigation
2. Checking element visibility immediately after click
3. Using .all() on dynamic elements without waiting
4. Hardcoded credentials ignoring 2FA which block some users
5. The test runs differently in headless vs your local browser, causing unexpected failures


Part 2: Explain Root Causes
1. CI/CD environments are slower than local machines, so pages or elements may load later
2. Dynamic elements may not be rendered immediately, causing assertions to fail
3. If a user has two-factor authentication, the login may not finish automatically
4. Headless browser behaves differently in CI
